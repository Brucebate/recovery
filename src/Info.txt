Problem no 1 -
How Todays page will work --
we will assign him 7 to 8 cases in which he can accept the case and can reject them
what will happen when he click on todays cases he will be directed to the 
TodaysCasespage which will show him 7 to 8 cases he can reject and accept the TodaysCasespage
those cases who are rejected will go on to the rejected cases in status as well as in todays history rejected cases
And the remaining cases will be shows in Todays cases




************************************
Problem no 2 -
To add the "Accepted" and "Rejected" icons only on the TodaysCasesPage without affecting other pages that use the CaseListComponent, you can pass a prop to the CaseListComponent to indicate whether the page should display the icons or not.

Here's the updated approach:
Modify TodaysCasesPage to pass a new prop (e.g., showIcons) to the CaseListComponent.

Update the CaseListComponent to conditionally render the icons when the showIcons prop is true.



***********************************
Problem no 3 -
TextInput components are only responding to input and pulling 
up the keyboard when you click on the placeholder.

so what I did is just add style of input field 
like input : {
    flex: 1,  // so with the help of this i get rid from this
}



*************************************** 
Problem no 3 --
to make the cases not touchable in History section pages
what I did is just create a prop inside the "CaseListComponent.js"
and pass the prop in history section like
<CaseListComponent isTouchale={false}>
so with this I cant able to touch the cases there

Problem no 4 ----
User can only able to navigate to CasesDetailspage when he will accept the case 
then only he will able to navigate to the details page
how --- in TodaysCasesPage  i write a  function handle the acceptedIcon

const handleAcceptCases = (acceptedCase) => {
        // Update the accepted state for the specific case and hide the icons
        setCases((prevCases) =>
            prevCases.map((caseItem) =>
                caseItem.id === acceptedCase.id
                    ? { ...caseItem, isAccepted: true, isRejected: false, showIcons: false } // Add `showIcons: false`
                    : caseItem
            )
        );
    };
In above code if i click on Accepted icon showIcons prop will become false and both 
icon will get dissappear


also i used if else condition for navigation if isAccepted is true then only 
user can move to the

Problem no 5 ---

what happening here is CasesDetailspage i am using the "HeaderComponent"
so inside that component I need to fetch the data from the sampleCases 
present inside the "TodaysCasesPage"  so what I did is

casesDetails prop is already I have inside the TodaysCasesPage
so I just pass that prop inside the "CaseDetailsPage"

how? ---
i use  "useRoute" as a route to get that prop

CaseDetailsPage --
    const route = useRoute();
    const caseDetails = route.params.caseDetails

HeaderComponent --
    const HeaderComponent = ({ caseDetails }) => {
//   const caseDetails = route?.params?.item || {}; // Default to empty object if not available
  console.log('Case Details:', caseDetails);


  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.customerName}>{caseDetails.customerName || 'No Customer Name'}</Text>
  )
    }
